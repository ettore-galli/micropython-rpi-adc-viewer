# Micropython development environment setup

This is about how to set up a working development environment for micropython with VS Code

## Some basic concepts

* Micropython is only needed on the device
* You need a tool to upload your source to the device, like mpremote (see below)
* You need stubs only to take advantage of autocompletion and linting, but not for the actual micropython program to run on the device.

## Install micropython on the device

1. Download the firmware

2. Follow the following instructions found in download page:

Flashing via UF2 bootloader

To get the board in bootloader mode ready for the
firmware update, execute machine.bootloader() at the
MicroPython REPL. Alternatively, hold down the BOOTSEL
button while plugging the board into USB. The uf2 file
below should then be copied to the USB mass storage
device that appears. Once programming of the new
firmware is complete the device will automatically
reset and be ready for use.

## Create a virtualenv on development machine

```shell
# Create the virtualenv (once)
python3.11 -m venv myvirtualenv 

# Activate the virtualenv (before using it)
source myvirtualenv/bin/activate
```

## Create a project

```shell
mkdir src
```

Then, write some micropython code in main.py

## Install micropython-cli

Micropython-cli is a tool whose main use is to get and install in current workspace the stubs used to perform autocompletion and syntax check.

Make sure your virtualenv is active

```shell
pip install --upgrade micropy-cli
pip install --upgrade micropy-cli[create_stubs]
```

## Install the stubs

### Stub installation

```shell
pip install micropython-rp2-pico_w-stubs
```

### Ignore residual possible pylance error

```python
from machine import ADC, Pin, I2C  # type: ignore

```

## Create a new project

```txt
src
    __init__.py
    main.py
```

## Install mpremote

```shell
pip install mpremote
```

## Basic mpremote usage

```shell

# Connect to device
mpremote

# Reset device (hard reset)
mpremote reset 

# Reset device (soft reset)
mpremote soft-reset

# Run script on device
mpremote run [path/to/local]/main.py  

# Send to device (main.py as main.py on device)
mpremote fs cp main.py :main.py

# Update the copy of utils/driver.py on the device, then execute app.py on the device.
# This is a common development workflow to update a single file and then re-start your program. In this scenario, your main.py on the device would also do import app.
# (example and explainationb copied from docs)

mpremote cp utils/driver.py :utils/driver.py + exec "import app"

# Update the copy of utils/driver.py on the device, then trigger a soft-reset to restart your program, and then monitor the output via the repl command.
# (example and explainationb copied from docs)

mpremote cp utils/driver.py :utils/driver.py + soft-reset repl

#Â Same as above, but update the entire utils directory first.
# (example and explainationb copied from docs)

mpremote cp -r utils/ :utils/ + soft-reset repl

```
